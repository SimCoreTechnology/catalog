# README #

Catalog, is a bare bones Laravel application designed to be a starting place for a backend code test.

### What is this repository for? ###

Candidates for SimCore Technologies backend software engineer positions.

### How do I get set up? ###

Follow instructions at laravel.com to get everything setup and running.

### Code Test Instructions ###

The goal of this project is to create an API backend for creating and retrieving data in a product catalog. 

There should be no front end, except for raw JSON responses. 

A DB is not required, as this project should use only Dummy Data.

While this will be an API, it does not require authentication for this test.

Please create the following:

* Standardized API end points.
* Create an end point that will create a product of a certain type by receiving a json string.
* Create an end point that will return a list of products in the system. 
* Create an end point that will return the details of a single product.

#### Considerations ####

While this is a simple product catalog. Product Type's needs to be a consideration, and each product type will have different attributes.

Product Types the system should support:

* Books
* Magazines
* Periodicles
* Academic Journals

Please be creative when comming up with unique attributes for each set.

### Who do I talk to? ###
